        <p> What once belonged to Maria is the only thing left of her from before. The Diary contains a messy stack of folded papers, coded pages, and sloppy messages written as if they were done quickly. Maria was smart to write about the events of each day, and in a language no one else could understand, but now they serve only to add to the mystery behind what's going on. Can you decipher what’s in it? </p>

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Maria's diary is found in the main area of the Lab next to Dr. Allans computer. Minerva can enter the lab upon entering the correct code into the door lock.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Maria was given the diary by her parents, and by proxy the scientists, as a way to write about her feelings and thoughts (and a way for the scientists to read about her symptoms and what she knows). They were all annoyed, however, when they opened the book to find out she had come up with her own language to write in. Without the key to read it, they took it from her and would simply state they didn't know where it was when she asked; but the diary would magically reappear in her room with a new entry. </p>

                    The lights on the keypad turned green, and the sound of a lock turning was heard from within the door. Expectantly, Minerva turned the knob and pushed the door open, cold air hitting her face immediately.
                    <br><br>
                    The room was especially bright, and it smells heavily of cleaning chemicals. Its contents were also either smashed on the floor or tossed aimlessly on the empty tables. Whoever had been here before had left, and in quite a hurry by the looks of it. Along the wall parallel to the entrance was a set of frosted glass windows. She tried to squint through them, but all she could see were splotches of red stuck to the other side of the window. She tried not to think about what it might be. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the corner, bright blue light came from the only activated computer in the room. Minerva approached the computer and found that it, too, was password protected. Here we go again. Looking down at the table, she spotted a little book held together by a rubber band. Pieces of paper jutted out from its seams, and it looked pretty old and tattered. On top of it was a post it, reading:
                    <br><br>
                    “I found her diary while she was under. Couldn’t understand most of it, it's almost all made up letters. Make sure to sedate her for longer so we can find the cypher, we need to make sure she doesn’t suspect anything. - Dr. Allan.” 
                    <br><br>
                    Confused, Minerva picked up the book and pulled off the rubber band. A piece of paper fell out, revealing a page full of the writing, the same as on the decoder Martin had sold her earlier. She picked up the paper that had fallen, and found that its message oddly wasn’t in code.
