            <p>
                Anna Moore (43) graduated from MIT with a degree in Bioengineering and Biology. She went on to study Physics and obtained her PhD, allowing her to begin working for bio-engineering company “Culminated Collectives Inc.” There Moore would conduct radical experiments, often away from the supervision of her superiors. When they found out what she had been doing in secret, the Committee stripped her of her titles and forbade Moore from continuing to study science. Angered by their closed minds, Moore created her own team of researchers, all estranged from their previous careers and all having felt betrayed by the scientific community. They would begin the events depicted in <em> DAUGHTER</em>.

            <summary> Personality</summary>
            <p>Due to her multiple years of study, Moore’s ego knows no bounds. She is often quiet, and cynical, and thinks she is smarter and better than almost everyone else (and she’ll let it be known too). Though she may suffer from refusing assistance from others, she excels at leading those who follow her, and removing those who do not. Do not get in her way.
