          <p>In the shadows lurks a shadow of her very own. Ripped from her home, from her family, her soul remains in a plight of rage, stalking the ruins of her home. A self made botchling. Though she can no longer remember what her life was before her erosion, she knows who has wronged her, and more importantly, who has taken her place. Revenge is not the word to describe her hunger. She simply Will Not Go. </p>

    <p>Born in the rocky lands of Pennsylvania, Maria was always a sickly child. It wasn't an uncommon occurance for her to spend nights in the hopsital, and over the years her parents grew more and more mornful over the death of their daughter. Of course, being still very much alive, she watched them in biterness and disappointment; they had all but given up on her and her illnesses. She grew even more resentful when they moved into a bigger, offputting house, and although she wouldn't tell them, she knew there were people watching her within the walls. And she was right. But it was already too late to leave when she met them.</p>

    <p>Maria was, for a long time, timid and nonconfrontational. Though still very smart, she opted to calculate her battles quietly, acting unassumingly as "the sick girl". But by the time she was a younge adult, she was a lot quicker to ask questions, even going as far as to snoop around restricted areas of the house. She was even clever enough to make up her own secret code. There isn't much to do stuck sick inside a house for months at a time, so she found her creatvity in her own special ways.

    <p>Long straight red hair with bangs frame her face, and she is often seen wearing a white sweater and cross. Though not religious, she supposed her family always needed a safety net for her soul. Anything could happen. She also looks increadibly similar to Minerva...
