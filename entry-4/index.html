    <h3>
      The Twins
  </h3>
  <br>
    <p> 
      Axel and Martin are a set of peculiar twins. Although polar opposites, they seem to be joined at the hip and do everything together - much to the dismay of Axel. Acting as the in-game merchants, The Twins will sell you (mostly) useful items they’ve scavenged to help you unlock other areas of the house. Earn their trust and they might even throw in a discount!

                Minerva was starting to get annoyed. She watched as the guy with white hair - Marvin? - grinned at her, clearly enjoying their haggle. His disinterested brother made a point of looking anywhere but at them. <br><br>
                "Fifteen. Final offer or I'm eating the paper." Marvin said, holding the folded paper up to his mouth as a threat. <br><br>
                She scowled and reluctantly handed him the soul shards. He gracfully placed the paper into her hands. <br><br>
                "Pleasure doing buisness. Please come again!" He cheered. Both Minerva and Axel rolled their eyes, and she unfolded the paper.

While Martin’s hair is dyed white, with messy black roots growing out from his head, Axel’s natural dark hair remains. Where Martin perfer’s band-tees and piercings, Axel is content in dark sweaters and his favorite jersey. Did we mention they’re joined at the hip?</td>

Axel on the other hand is quiet, and tends to keep to himself. His passive attitude means that he's constantly annoyed with Martin’s loud demeanor, and constantly wishes for space and quiet. </td>
